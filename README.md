## Notes

My biggest challenges with the pre-work was not fully related to the pre-work process. I did not have access to any MacOS and therefore it was very challenging for me to continue this course. I bought a MacBook Air from the Apple Store but it would be shipped after the deadline and midway through I decided to changed to BestBuy since they will be delivering before the deadline, unfortunately BestBuy delayed their shipping and that made my situtaion a lot trickier. I was finally able to borrow my friends MacBook to finish the work before the deadline. There were challlenges beyond that too. All the videos were from before the new Xcode update I had to figure out a lot of the features by myself because there weren't that much information on the new XCode 12 available online. I definitely was in a heavy time crunch otherwise I would have certainly taken a shot at implementing all the features.
